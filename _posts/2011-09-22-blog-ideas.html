<ul>
<li>The development of "World Simulation"</li>
<li>Emphasis on character personalities in relation to each other, not just the world around them.  Dwarf Fortress had personalities but only limited their own actions and their actions to the environment around them rather than to the other dwarves around them.  By creating personalities to each other will make a more interesting system.  What does this mean if you cannot choose your dwarves and they don't get along.  Would it be better if you could choose your group? Guild instead of Family? More strategy?</li>
<li>Progression of art developed for the game, probably later.  Can talk about the header.  These will probably be short posts.</li>
<li>The problem of maps, vision.  Addressing the broader problem of character knowledge and limiting character awareness.  Idea of each character having their own perception of the world and therefore their own map.  When a character dies, that part of the map gets lost if they have not passed it on to another family member.  Additionally, characters can receive info from other characters in the world, enlarging their map awareness to places they haven't visited or updating it since they were last there</li>
<li>Looking back on Fealty.  What were the problems I encountered and what did that experience teach me?  Some ideas were unique but the broad scope of it was simply a rip-off of the generic browser mmo genre.</li>
<li>Influences of other games: Dwarf Fortress, Cantr II, Utopia (browser games), settlers (board games)</li>
<li>Discussion of other blogs and the ideas they have (good way to interact with the broader blog community and increase traffic) Include these every once in awhile</li>
<li>How to go about discussing family dynamics, character interaction with player</li>
</ul>
