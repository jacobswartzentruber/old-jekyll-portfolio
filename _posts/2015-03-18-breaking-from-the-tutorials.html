<p>Onward and upward!  It was only a matter of time before I had to take the leap and break away from the confine of tutorials.  While tutorials are a great way to simulate the workflow of coding an application, it is hard to think critically when the steps are laid out right in front of you.  Taking the next step past tutorials is daunting to say the least but I am excited to tackle original problems and learn the intricacies of how things work.</p>
<p>One thing I have read over and over is to tackle a project you are excited about.  If you have a project that is personally appealing, the problems won't be mind-numbing drudgery but will spur you to dig into the details.  The second thing I have heard is to pick a project that isn't too involved.  Stick to bite-sized portions of code and the probability of burning out decreases significantly.</p>
<p>With these thoughts in mind I decided I want to program a rock climbing application to track the various routes I have climbed and suggest workouts for various skill levels.  When you sign into the application you will be able to catalog each route you complete along with images, betas and number of attempts it took you to complete.  You can create a workout that logs the amount and intensity of routes you did on that specific day.  As the number of workouts are logged, you can pull up a graph of your progress.  This is the skeleton app that I want to build.  The hardest part will be organizing the associations between models.</p>
<p>If the application seems functional once the skeleton structure is complete I have a few ideas for add-ons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request friendship between users.  Users can see what routes friends have accomplished, what routes they are working on, posts for bragging rights and tips.</li>
<li>Include gym and park profiles.  Gyms could keep track of all their routes (even ones that have been taken down), success rates for each route and feedback from climbers.</li>
<li>Challenges. Create a challenge and see which of your friends finishes first.  Challenges could be posted by gyms with some sort of reward.</li>
<li>Forums for finding climbing buddies</li>
</ul>
<p>I am excited to begin programming this new application.  Hopefully I can learn a lot in the process.  As a side note, if you know of any cool mockup applications please let me know!</p>
