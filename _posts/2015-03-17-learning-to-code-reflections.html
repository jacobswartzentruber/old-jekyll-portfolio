<p>This morning I stumbled across a blog post by Viking Code School entitled, "<a href="http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard">Why learning to code is so damn hard.</a>"  I wanted to take a few minutes to reflect on this post and talk about my own journey at this point in time.  I realize their blog post is biased because they have incentive to encourage readers to sign up for their courses.  With this in mind I am not taking everything they have to say to heart but I think there are some valid points here to be discussed.</p>
<p>Their post charts the course of learning to program web applications, specifically charting confidence over competence, resource density and scope of knowledge over time.  Here is the graph they created:</p>
<p><img class="image-center" title="Coding is hard graph" src="/assets/coding_is_hard_combined_chart.png?w=300" alt="Coding is hard graph" width="900" height="834" /></a></p>
<p>This graph resonated with me because everything I have encountered so far fits this model.  I have passed through the initial hand-holding honeymoon and am thoroughly settled in the cliffs of confusion, a stone's throw from the desert of despair.  I have learned and solidified all the basic syntax required for web applications.  I have tried programming my own application and have encountered the monster that is debugging.  I wanted to solidify my knowledge of test driven development so I spent a week and a half running through tutorials again.  Now that the tutorials are done, I am once again staring down the daunting path of individual development.  I have already noticed a decrease in the amount of material that could be helpful for my stage of development (perhaps that is why I went back to tutorials?).</p>
<p>While the road ahead is going to be incredibly hard, I take solace in the fact that this is how it is for everybody.  I think this is why this particular blog post grabbed my attention.  There are so many resources about learning to pursue web application development online that it is hard to pick through the noise for anything meaningful.  It is hard to find and frame the larger picture when the mass of material is so extensive and localized.  This graph, while projecting difficult times in the future, gives me hope because it attempts to generate a broader view of the learning process.</p>
<p>In addition to hope, there are a number of things this graph solidifies as I think about moving forward.  I realize my technical manuals and books are about to become my new best friend.  I am about to dive into the lifeblood of web applications and will need their detailed minutiae to stay afloat.  With the basic syntax and structure behind me, I need to build up that intermediate knowledge through experience and experience alone.  Additionally, I want to work with other people to learn their coding styles.  I don't know yet where I will find this, whether locally or through forums, but I believe this can have a huge impact on making my way through the desert of despair.  Simply learning from somebody who has already gone through the process will be incredibly productive and instructive.</p>
<p>I just need to keep pushing forward, writing my own programs and learning from my mistakes, however arduous it may be.</p>
