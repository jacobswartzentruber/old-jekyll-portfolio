<p>Three posts in one day!? Am I looking to seek out and destroy all motivation to write blog posts ever again!?  Well, I figured I had a bit of catching up to do since I started working on web application development full time.  I started full-time on Monday and want to document as much of my progress as possible.  Since I missed the first two days I need to make that up by buckling down a bit for blog posts.  Hey, if this keeps up my writing might improve to passable by the end of the year!  At this point though its more about the record keeping than how well people can stomach my inane sentence construction.</p>
<p>Yesterday was my first day delving into JavaScript and jQuery and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  In fact, out of all the languages I have learned so far it might be my favorite.  For those who don't know, JavaScript is used by a web browser to provide client-side functionality to a webpage over the generic static HTML and CSS.  When you travel to a webpage and you find cool drop-down menus and slick slideshows, that would be JavaScript in action.  jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies the manipulation of HTML elements in a webpage.</p>
<p>There are three functions of JavaScript as it manipulates a webpage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Event Handling:  JavaScript adds Action Listeners to a webpage which allow the webpage to react to user input.  Action Listeners include mouse clicks and keyboard presses.  Javascript can assign an Action Listener to an HTML element so when that element is clicked or the keyboard is used, an action may be taken on the webpage.</li>
<li>Document Object Model (DOM) Manipulation:  JavaScript can actively manipulate HTML elements, whether that be redefining what text appears or creating new HTML elements altogether.</li>
<li>Effects:  JavaScript can alter the appearance, visibility and order of HTML elements.  HTML elements can be hidden, revealed and animated to fly across the screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>To practice these concepts I programmed a magic-eight ball to deliver answers when clicked.  When clicked, it shakes on the screen and slowly reveals the answer, letting it sit there for awhile until finally fading out.  There is a fifty percent probability it says "Worth" or "Not Worth." I call it the "Magic Worth Ball."  I need to find a way to upload these practice exercises so they are accessible for interaction.  At the moment, you will have to settle for a picture.</p>

<p>Not very fancy, I agree, but I am intensely proud of it at the moment!  JavaScript works!</p>
