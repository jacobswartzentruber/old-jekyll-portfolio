<p>I have come to the conclusion that to fully explore a wide variety of development opportunities I should develop numerous smaller sites rather than spend all my time on one large site.  I want the material I am absorbing to stick in my brain, especially when this material is spread widely across five distinct languages.  What better way to do this than through repetition, repetition, repetition?  I have decided I will develop one site a week to the best of my abilities and then move on to the next one.  This way I can gather experience from different types of sites and the different problems each one possesses.  After one month, I will re-evaluate and see what progress has been made.</p>
<p>This week I will be developing a Twitter clone.  Up until now, I have been working with each language independently.  My goal for this project is simply to understand the mechanics of piecing them all together.  I don't have any specific goals for this first project other than this attempt at unification.  It is very much a "get my feet wet" type of project.</p>
<p>This afternoon, I put together the Rails scaffolding to display, create and delete Tweets.  There is no user authentication at this point and the site acts as if all incoming input came from the same user.  My first hurdle is understanding how CSS and JavaScript work within the Rails framework.  It turns out the Rails command "stylesheet_link_tag(*sources)" allows me to link CSS stylesheets.  While I was looking into this I discovered the Bootstrap Gem which looks incredibly promising.  Bootstrap utilizes the CSS preprocessor, SASS, and provides numerous custom HTML and CSS components.  After pulling the framework for managing Tweets together in Rails, I installed Bootstrap and managed to get some nice formatting started for the index page.</p>

<p>From what little time I have spent with Bootstrap, it seems like it will save a lot of time and energy with all of the custom options it provides.  I shouldn't rely on it too heavily because I want to learn and be familiar with the nitty-gritty CSS building blocks but it definitely makes layouts easier!</p>
<p>Questions I have that came up over the course of the day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it possible to use JavaScript to submit a RESTful 'Create' request since the page is never redirected?  I have only ever created Tweets by linking through a 'New' page and am curious whether I can create Tweets through a form managed by JavaScript.</li>
<li>How do I get the JavaScript functionality of Bootstrap to merge with Rails?  In fact, how do I get vanilla JavaScript to interact with Rails?</li>
<li>Can I use JavaScript on Ruby Code?</li>
<li>Is the application.css.sass file a master CSS file?  If I generate custom stylesheets, can I override this master file for specific pages?</li>
</ul>
