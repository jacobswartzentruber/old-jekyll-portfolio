<p>While the majority of my work in the last few months has been spent on back-end development and front-end interactivity, I wanted to take a few days to verse myself in basic front-end design concepts.  I thoroughly enjoyed taking art classes in high school and college, I sketch in my free time to relieve stress and love exploring the intricacies of tablet drawing in Photoshop.  While I consider myself well-founded in artistic principles, I have surprisingly never taken a class in graphic design.  I thought it was high time to become familiar with basic design concepts so I can, at a minimum, create passable mockups and discuss presentation considerations with designers.</p>
<p>To gain an overview of the field and familiarize myself with the broad concepts and terminology I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Principles-Beautiful-Web-Design/dp/098057689X"><em>The Principles of Beautiful Web Design</em> by Jason Beaird</a>. I first wanted to read a published book before exploring concepts on the web because books tend to have a cohesive, unifying structure rather than a variable conglomerate of dissimilar resources.  As I read through the book, I was tempted to find additional resources about specialized concepts before I had even finished the chapter -- everything was just so interesting!  Before I get ahead of myself though, I wanted to summarize a bit about what I discovered when designing layouts and elements for the web.</p>
<p><b>Grid Theory</b></p>
<p>As CSS is structured around a Box model and Bootstrap is configured to use a grid system, I found it incredibly beneficial to learn about grid theory which inspired these models.  Grid theory helps the designer configure all elements of a webpage to be square, to line up appropriately and to be well proportioned.  Grid theory dictates the designer create a grid on their working surface, usually split into 12, 16 or 24 columns, on which elements are positioned.  This underlying grid helps the designer create a unified structure rather than laying elements in a haphazard way.</p>
<p>The Rule of Thirds stems from Grid Theory and reflects the Golden Ratio, a ratio often found in nature that has been determined to be pleasing to the eye.  The Rule of Thirds states that elements should be one-third and two-thirds proportionate to each other in order to create the most pleasing effect.  When elements are positioned accordingly, the resulting webpage feels balanced and finished.  The Rule of Thirds is an aide, however, and does not need to be taken literally for every element on the page.  Use it when you can, but do not take it as an absolute.</p>
<p><strong>Color</strong></p>
<p>It is incredibly easy to pick any set of colors for a theme, however, it takes a lot more skill to pick a set of colors that actually work well together.  Color is one of those design considerations that tends to make or break a site.  Our brains find certain color combinations pleasing and other combinations revolting while we might not be able to place our finger on why this occurs.  Additionally, specific colors tend to raise particular emotions depending on the cultural context in which we were raised.  Thankfully, there are tips and tricks designers use to develop appropriate color combinations for reflecting specific themes.</p>
<p>One such trick is to pick specific color arrangements on the color wheel.  There are a number of combinations that generate pleasing palettes over their random counterparts.  A monochromatic color scheme utilizes one base color with a variety of tints or shades of that color.  Below you can see a monochromatic color palette created at <a href="http://paletton.com/">Palleton.com.</a></p>
<p><img class="image-center" title="monochromatic-palette" src="/assets/monochromatic-palette.png" alt="monochromatic palette" width="300" height="56" /></p>
<p>An analogous color scheme utilizes colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel.  Beaird states that when using an analogous color scheme it is best to keep your range of colors within one-third of the wheel, otherwise the scheme tends to fall apart.</p>
<p><img class="image-center" title="analogous-palette" src="/assets/analogous-palette.png" alt="analogous palette" width="300" height="56" /></p>
<p>Complementary color schemes consist of colors opposite each other on the color wheel.  Using these types of schemes help make elements "pop."  When using these schemes, do not use the colors in a foreground-background relationship, because they tend to become overwhelming.</p>
<p><img class="image-center" alt="complementary-palette" src="/assets/complementary-palette.png" alt="complementary palette" width="300" height="56" /></p>
<p>Finally, there are split-complementary, triadic and tetradic color schemes which utilize sets of analogous colors opposite the color wheel from each other.</p>
<p><img class="image-center" title="split-complementary palette" src="/assets/split-complementary-palette.png" alt="split-complementary palette" width="300" height="56" /></p>
<p>Beyond these color schemes, it is a matter of experimentation and discovering "what feels right."  These schemes though will go a long way toward creating an appropriate color scheme and dictating the appropriate mood.</p>
<p><strong>Typography</strong></p>
<p>Before I read this book, I took typography for granted.  So long as the words themselves correctly communicate the appropriate idea, they have done their job, right?  Boy, was I wrong!  The detail and body of knowledge appropriated for typography is beyond anything I previously imagined.  From the spacing of individual letters down to the minuscule customization of serifs, each typographic choice influences the tone of the site and how readers interpret the presented material.  The depth of material appropriate for typography could fill an entire blog so I will limit myself here to a few key features.</p>
<p>Typography for the web is a bit more limited than typography for printed material as the number of fonts available are limited by browser specifications.  Even still, web typography has a number of typeface distinctions that provide the designer with a wide variety of options.  Typeface distinctions help us categorize fonts and font-families, each with their own historical significance and connotations.  Lets take a look at a few of them.</p>
<p>Serif fonts are historically used for the content of a site and are dictated by the embellishes on the end of a letter's termini.  The classification of a serif can influence the theme of your site to a large degree.  For instance, old-style serifs, with transitions between thick and thin strokes and rounded corners, evoke an old-timey, more historical feel.  Garamond is a font that uses old-style serifs,</p>
<p><strong style="font-family:Garamond;font-size:300%;">GARAMOND</strong></p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, slab serifs evoke a more modern, industrial feel. Courier is classified as a slab-serif font.</p>
<p><strong style="font-family:Courier;font-size:300%;">COURIER</strong></p>
<p>Sans-serif fonts were created in retaliation to the rise of serif fonts and tend to have a cleaner feel to them.  Historically, they have primarily been used for the headings and titles of a webpage. Arial is a font that is sans-serif.</p>
<p><strong style="font-family:Arial;font-size:300%;">ARIAL</strong></p>
<p>Apparently, typography is an incredibly rich and intricate field and people spend entire lifetimes plumbing its depths.  What I have touched on here is only the very tip of a field that is incredibly rich and ever-evolving.  I learned a lot more than what I presented in this blog post, and even still, my current knowledge is simply a drop in the bucket.  I am glad I was able to take the time to better understand design considerations and am anxious to dive into the countless web resources available.  Perhaps I will write a few more blog posts on design in the future as I discover more and am able to experiment with the principles I encounter.</p>
