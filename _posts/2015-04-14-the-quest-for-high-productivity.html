<p>I wanted to get more experience finishing applications that are a little more manageable than ClimbON, so I started a new application for tracking personal goals.  I know now that applications can grow beyond your skill level pretty easily if you aren't careful.  Throwing oneself in the deep end with an ambitious project is productive at times, however, since I still need to completely finish a project that is all my own, I was a bit ahead of myself with ClimbON.  I am definitely going to keep working on it since it is a project I am really excited about, just at a slower pace.  In the meantime, I decided to try my hand at designing a productivity application.</p>
<p>The inspiration for this new project stems from my time learning web application development.  Since I am the sole contributor behind my work and any output I produce, my motivation in part stems from how much progress I think I have made on a problem.  Whenever it takes awhile to solve a problem, my ability to see the broader picture tends to cloud over because I have only one pair of eyes on the situation.  I want to solve this dilemma by designing an application that tracks any progress I have made toward a specific goal and displaying those results in an easily digestible manner.  By presenting information in a concise, visual manner, it should jog my brain to think of the bigger picture and not get stuck on trivial problems.  To give it a little twist, I want to reference end goals as "quests" and provide the option to add a bit of gamification down the road if this app becomes more complex.</p>
<p>You can follow development of this application at my <a href="https://github.com/jacobswartzentruber/quest_app">GitHub repository here</a>.</p>
<p>Primary goals for this application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document any problems/solutions spanning the entire development process when developing an app from scratch</li>
<li>More practice with RSpec and other testing frameworks</li>
<li>Understand and utilize the Devise gem to create the authentication system</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondary goals for this application:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display results in a visibly appealing and concise manner</li>
<li>Keep total number of pages to a minimum and focus relevant information to a maximum of two pages.  It should be easy to access and update.</li>
</ul>
