<p>If you notice, the menu bar has expanded and grown a bit today.  I decided to develop this blog a little more and fashion a space that would do more than simply record blog posts.  I wanted to create a space where I could showcase my work and gather educational resources I find informative.  The new pages include:</p>
<p>About - A little about myself</p>
<p>Web Projects - I didn't have time to get to this today, but will include quick summaries of the various web applications I design along with links to their GitHub repositories</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Projects - Summaries and links to projects outside the realm of web development I have designed</p>
<p>Resources - A compilation of tutorials, podcasts and articles I find informative during this learning period</p>
