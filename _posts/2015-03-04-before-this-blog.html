<p>This blog isn't the first step I have taken in pursuing web application development.  I am using this post to explain where I am currently at.  I am still at a relatively elementary stage but do have some concepts under my belt that will be beneficial moving forward.</p>
<p>In the last month and a half I wanted to create a base of general knowledge that would help me before I got into more complex concepts.  To begin my study, I completed courses from Codecademy and Code School which explained the basic concepts behind HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails and Python.  While I will not be focusing on Python for this course of study, I thought it was a good idea to familiarize myself with alternative languages to notice differences in syntax and structure.  The HTML/CSS courses were incredibly helpful in understanding the "Box" model of website construction and how page layouts are structured.  These markup languages format and position the content of a static web page to show what the user sees in their final web browser.  While HTML and CSS are great at making a website look organized, I have yet to find extended functionality for them beyond creating links to other pages.</p>
<p>Ruby and Rails will be where I focus most of my time because these languages are what comprise the "application" part of a web application.  In addition to the online courses, I am reading "The Rails 4 Way" and "Programming Ruby" (otherwise known as the pickaxe book).  I was recommended these books to best understand the intricacies of both languages and am so far impressed with what I have discovered.  I have programmed clones of simple blogs and can create a basic web application requesting and manipulating data on a server.</p>
<p>I will spend many blog posts trying to understand the intricacies of these languages but for the purposes of this post I will simply summarize what I have learned.  I am coming to grasps with the "Model-View-Controller" structure of Rails and am learning "CRUD" and RESTful actions.  In short, Rails is a strict structure that defines how a server should be organized through the use of Models.  Models are defined tables that illustrate where data is stored on a server.  Controllers are the logic behind the webpage and dictate how to manipulate data from the Models.  Controllers request and operate on data from Models, arranging it in variables that may be accessed by the View.   The View uses the variables created by the Controller to display the information to the user in a concise and readable format through Embedded Ruby HTML.</p>
<p>This sums up where I am at now.  I am excited to go beyond the basics and begin diving into the more complex components of Ruby, Rails, Javascript, HTML and CSS.</p>
