<p>I have often found that to most efficiently learn a subject, it is important to teach the material in question to others.  To be able to explain to another person how specific concepts work solidifies your own knowledge of the material and perhaps opens new avenues of understanding.  I have started this blog in the hope that documenting my progress learning the intricacies of web application development will increase the value I obtain from working on my own projects.</p>
<p>I envision this blog to be many things.  First, it will be a place where I can document daily progress on various projects I am working on.  This will provide a bar I can measure my development against and show how much work I have completed within a certain amount of time.  Second, I want to be able to discuss various programming/design concepts and understand what role they play and how they all fit together to create a website. Since I will be teaching myself Ruby, Rails, Javascript etc., I need structure to organize my thoughts and solidify the knowledge I have gained in writing.  Finally, I need a place to gather all the information I find online in a reference section. I hope this blog provides some sense of transparency for the learning process and allows me to think about concepts in new ways.</p>
<p>Please reach out to me if you have comments, ideas or criticisms of the material I put out.  Since this is one big learning experience for me, any feedback is greatly appreciated as it will allow me to further engage with the material.  Let the journey commence!</p>
