<p>Over the last few days I have been working on completing and trying to understand User Management.  I have been inundated with so much new information it is overwhelming but intoxicating at the same time.  I will probably have to dedicate an entire blog post to what I have learned when it comes to temporary vs. permanent user authentication.  To hold you over until I write that blog post, I will have to summarize.  In short, temporary user authorization is handled through the use of sessions.  A variable user_id is stored in this session when a user logs in.  The user_id variable does not need to be encrypted because sessions are automatically encrypted when created.  When a user logs out or exits the browser, the user_id is deleted and the browser no longer holds any reference to a user.</p>
<p>In contrast, if a user needs to be remembered across sessions, things get a bit more complicated.  Permanent sessions are stored in 'cookies.'  These cookies are stored in the browser and hold data which can be accessed by websites when needed.  For permanent user authorization on a computer, the variable user_id is stored on a permanent signed cookie.  This cookie is not encrypted however and is susceptible to releasing its information to a malicious party.  As such, a second cookie is created for each session.  This cookie holds a remember_token that is passed through a hash encryption.  The remember_token is also stored on the user model.  For a malicious party to sign in to a user account, they would need the user_id cookie as well as access to the remember_token cookie.  Since the remember_token is generated every session, this makes hacking extremely difficult.</p>
<p>As I was working through the User Management system it struck me how fundamental this is to almost every site.  The user model is one of the most basic features in most sites; almost everything else branches off from the user.  For instance, Twitter has users who create tweets.  Each tweet is attached to a user.  Likes, hashtags and favorites are attached to the tweets themselves.  By developing the User model first it is much easier to begin constructing everything else off of that.  I want to try out this theory for my next practice site instead of constructing the Tweets model first like I did with Twitter Clone.</p>
<p>I used a couple of new gems that I think are worth mentioning.  The first is <a title="Faker gem" href="https://rubygems.org/gems/faker">'faker'</a> gem.  Faker is a gem which allows you populate your development database with fake data.  I used it to populate my User model with one hundred different users, all with 'faker' generated names and emails.  The second gem I was introduced to is the <a title="Will_paginate gem" href="https://rubygems.org/gems/will_paginate">'will_paginate'</a> gem.  Will_paginate takes a long aggregated list of instances and splits them into manageable groups to be used on a webpage.  For instance, my list of one hundred users is too unwieldy to display on one page.  Will_paginate took my list and split it into distinct pages of thirty users apiece.  Below is a screenshot of the user page using fake names and paginated lists.</p>

<p>Now that the User management system is set up and working, it is becoming apparent that I need to update my development environment.  There are a few programs I want to become familiar with before I develop more code.  The first is Virtual Box and Vagrant.  Since I am working on a Windows computer I want to get a virtual machine running Linux up as soon as possible.  When I try to write integration tests on Windows, I keep getting a bunch of errors.  Testing is an important part of development and I fear if I do not create a virtual machine soon, I will develop the habit of coding without writing tests along the way.  Second, I want to set up Git and Heroku so I can get in the habit of pushing changes to these platforms for version control.  Like writing tests, I want to make pushing changes to these programs second nature.  I don't want to strike out on shaky footing but rather develop an accumulation of well-founded habits.</p>
<p>Creating the perfect development environment simply has to be done even though it isn't something I find particularly gripping like developing the actual logic of a program. For all the fun and interesting topics Ruby on Rails offers there is always that one boring topic which is the key to exploring the interesting ones.</p>
<p>To conclude, I downloaded <a title="Sublime Text" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>, a text editor for code, markup and prose.  I was using Aptana Studio up until now but it felt clunky, as if it were another program re-purposed for web development.  I am excited to try out Sublime Text as it is much sleeker and not overburdened with an excess of tools and options.</p>
