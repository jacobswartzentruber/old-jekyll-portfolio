<p>At the beginning of this blog, I stated I was going to use BitBucket over GitHub as my Git repository hosting service of choice.  This decision was based on the assumption that I would want unlimited access to private repositories as I develop my various programs.  I naively thought I should make my code private since I am not looking to create open-source projects.  What I didn't realize was I gave up the opportunity for other developers and future employers to view my code and see how much I have learned.  I need to be forward-focused and cultivate an environment which showcases all of my work in an easily accessible manner.  GitHub is perfect for promoting this open-arms philosophy with its public repositories and even tracks the amount of commits a developer makes over time.  You can now find all my repositories in my <a href="https://github.com/jacobswartzentruber">GitHub account, accessible here.</a></p>
<p>What solidified my transition from BitBucket to GitHub was GitHub's ability for hosting sites, perfect for creating a developer blog.  I know what you are thinking, "But Jacob, you already have a blog here!  Why are you thinking about starting over?"  Yes, I have this blog on Wordpress, but I have always intended to develop a blog on my own domain.  The free Wordpress account I have is great because it provides an incredible amount of widgets and a stable environment.  It lacks the ability to customize however and comes across a bit amateurish.  If I am going to be a professional web application developer, I want to design my own blog and create all of the custom formatting.  There are just so many slick features I could implement!  With the Git.io domain I would be able to realize this dream and begin development of a custom blog.  It's time to start thinking big!</p>
<p>The majority of my morning was occupied by Climber and Gym user functionality for ClimbON.  Signups and logins are working smoothly.  You can now edit the Climber and Gym profiles.  Activation and password reset emails are being sent out correctly.  I still want to write a few integration tests to secure any errant bugs I might have missed, but everything should be working well.  If you want to see how the site looks at this point in time, I pushed everything to the <a title="ClimbON" href="https://glacial-bastion-8007.herokuapp.com/">ClimbON Heroku server</a>.</p>
<p>I decided today I am going to spend an hour or so every day working on increasing my Ruby knowledge.  I have been spending so much time in the Rails framework that I rarely use Ruby all by itself.  If I can develop my basic Ruby competence to a higher state, all areas of my web application programming will improve.  Rails concepts will make more sense and I will be able to manipulate Rails methods easier.  I plan to spend my hour every day working from <a title="Project Euler" href="projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a>, an archive of mathematical problems ideally solved through the use of computer programming.  I hope this time allows me to explore different aspects of Ruby I haven't yet encountered or had the opportunity to use.  With the new GitHub account up and running, I have started posting my solutions which you may <a href="https://github.com/jacobswartzentruber/project_euler">view in this repository</a>.</p>
