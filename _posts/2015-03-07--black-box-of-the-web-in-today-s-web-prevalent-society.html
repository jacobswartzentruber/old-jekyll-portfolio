<p>talk about how we use the web for everything nowadays but most of us don't know what it is or what its capabilities are.  Much like a car where I know how to control it but if it broke down I couldn't pin point what was wrong.  Web is worse because we use it for so much more.  THIS is why I went into web design.  It is fascinating and scary at the same time.</p>
