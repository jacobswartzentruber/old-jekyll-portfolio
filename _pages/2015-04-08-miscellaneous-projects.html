<p>When I am not working on increasing my web application knowledge I enjoy working on numerous other side projects.  I have an odd fascination with procedural generation, artificial intelligence and game design so that is where my efforts tend to point when I want to explore something new.  Below you will find a list of various projects I have completed in the past.  If you wish to know more about a project, simply click on the relevant title below</p>
<p><a title="World Generation Project" href="https://acuriouscrossbreed.wordpress.com/world-generation-project/">World Generation Project</a> - This program procedurally generates landscapes based on elevation, temperature and precipitation maps.  Every map generated is unique but still remains coherent and unified.  I have always been fascinated by procedural generation and this project remains my outlet for sating those curiosity spikes.  Programmed in Java.</p>
<p><a title="Fealty" href="https://acuriouscrossbreed.wordpress.com/fealty-2/">Fealty</a> - Fealty is an online strategy game focused on acquiring land, complementary resource accumulation and dynamic player hierarchy.  This was my first large program, created all the way back in high school.  The spaghetti code is real with this one but it taught me an incredible amount about object oriented programming and creating large-scale applications.  Programmed in Java.</p>
<p><a title="Project Euler Solutions Repository" href="https://github.com/jacobswartzentruber/project_euler">Project Euler</a> - I have been working my way through the problems on the Project Euler website.  They are a great way to practice my Ruby coding and allow me little challenges every day.  The link will take you to my GitHub repository.  Programmed in Ruby.</p>
