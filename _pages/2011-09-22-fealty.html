<p>Fealty is a tick-based online strategy game focused around developing mutual networks of resource accumulation and working within a player-based feudal system.  Sadly, the online aspect of the game has not come to fruition yet due to a lack of server programming knowledge on my part.  I am working toward remedying this deficit, however it might remain an offline game for an indefinite period of time.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="strongholdTile" src="assets/strongholdtile.gif" alt="" width="60" height="60" />Gameplay centers around the management of player controlled territories, extracting resources and taxes in order to build an infrastructure capable of acquiring more territories and resisting assault.  The player holds one territory as their "home" territory.  This territory is signified with a castle token on the map. If the home territory is taken by an opponent, the opponent becomes "king" over the player, and the player's status becomes that of a vassal to the opponent.  Therefore, the home territory is of upmost priority and must be protected at all costs.  Once in vassal state, the player must give up a percentage of their gold, resources and army (exact percentages dictated by the king) to their king every turn.  In return, the king provides his own army as defense against other intruders into the player's kingdom.  Eventually an entire feudal structure is built up over time as kings take over more vassals and those vassals take over other players, culminating in a large web of mutual and conflicting loyalties</p>

<p><a href="http://portfolioswartz.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/weavingtile.gif"><img title="weavingTile" src="assets/weavingtile.gif" alt="" width="60" height="60" /></a>Players acquire resources in two distinct ways.  The first is through taxation.  For every peasant the player owns underneath his control, the player gains a set sum of money every turn dictated by the taxation rate.  The second form of resource acquisition are through "deeds."  Deeds can be applied to the other five resources in the game; food, wood, stone, textiles and iron.  These resources are spread throughout a continent randomly and are dictated by the various colors on a territory.  Food is represented by a grain field, wood by a forest, stone by grey stone, textiles by a pasture and iron by red mountains.  These cannot be acquired unless they are cultivated which takes an large amount of gold.  Due to the large investment required, multiple players can donate resources toward the cultivation of a territory even if they do not own it.  In return, the donating players receive a "deed" giving them a percentage of future resources generated in direct correlation to how much gold they donated.  Thus, deeds become resources in themselves as they can be bought and sold on a "deed market."  This feature allows poorer players to acquire resources even though they do not have enough money to cultivate their own territories.  Due to the large investment required for cultivating territories, resources are scarce and are thus a valuable commodity.  Resources are needed to buy the majority of units and buildings meaning players with resources get a leg up on their competition.  Fealty can bring out the selfish side in people as they compete against each other, but through resource accumulation they must ultimately work together.</p>
<p>If players believe their military might is sufficient to take over other territories then they have the option of conducting military affairs.  Military units are split into four different types; militia, footsoldiers, longbowmen and knights.  Militia only require gold to hire and are therefore the staple to any army.  Even poor players can afford them.  The other military units require resources to purchase and are therefore built by players who have a wide economy established.  Footsoldiers excel in attacking however lack strength when it comes to defense.  Conversely, longbowmen are adept defenders but do not provide much support attacking.  Knights are the most powerful unit in the game as they excel at both attacking and defending, providing a solid fighting force when added to any army.  Attacking a territory is completed in two stages; siege and assault.  If the defending army has any sort of walls or towers the attacking army must first use their trebuchets to break through.  If the attacking army is successful in breaking down the walls the battle between units may commence.  If they fail, the attacking army must walk away without tasting combat.  Combat is carried out in stages where the attacker is provided statistics on how many units were lost in the previous stage.  At the conclusion of a stage the attacker may choose to flee or continue the assault.  If the attacker is successful in destroying all defending units, the territory becomes his or hers and they may choose to keep or destroy all deeds in the territory if it has been cultivated.</p>
<p>Other aspects of the game include a marketplace where players can buy and sell resources, a deed market where players can buy and sell deeds,  colonizing uncharted lands, conducting espionage against other players to spy on what lays behind formidable fortifications and rebelling against other players higher in the fealty hierarchy if their actions have been too selfish or self-centered.</p>
