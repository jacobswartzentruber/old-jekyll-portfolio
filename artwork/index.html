<p>Give me the choice between a night going to a sports event and a night spent sketching in a sketchbook, I will choose drawing nine times out of ten (I have to fit soccer in there sometimes).  I love drawing, designing, observing and representing the world around me.  While it has always played a secondary role behind other professional interests, it remains a defining force in my life and I still break out the pens or dive into Photoshop a few times a week.</p>

<p>I grew up drawing with pencils, inks and pastels and primarily worked with those mediums throughout high school.  In college I discovered the wonders of computer tablet drawing and eagerly dove into mastering the intricacies of Photoshop.  I have drawn on the computer ever since, barring sketching in my sketchbook, and have additionally experimented using Paint Shop Pro and Gimp.  For the majority of my drawings I prefer line sketching and utilizing a greyscale shading technique although I have recently been trying to work more color into my drawings.  Below you will find a number of pieces I have completed throughout the years.</p>
