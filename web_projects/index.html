<p>It is often said, the best way to increase understanding of a topic is to devote yourself to projects you are personally excited about.  What happens when someone wants to become more experienced in a field that requires mastering, not just one, but a variable host of complex concepts and techniques?  Say, full-stack development?  Create numerous applications that incorporate and fortify your other personal interests, of course!  These are web-based projects I have developed to practice my coding abilities and solve problems I have encountered in other areas of my life.  If you wish to know more about a project, simply click onÂ the relevant title below.</p>

<h4><a title="ClimbON" href="{{ site.url }}/web_projects/climbON/">ClimbON - Rock Climbing Application</a></h4>
<p>ClimbON is a Ruby on Rails web application that acts as a platform for climbing gyms to track, manage and promote routes set on their walls.  Individual climbers registered through ClimbON can browse routes set by gyms, track their progress on specified routes and share their climbing history with other climbers.  As individual climbers work on routes and develop projects, gyms are able to access and aggregate this data to determine which walls are most popular, calculate the experience differential of their clientele and easily gather feedback.</p>

<h4><a title="Quest" href="{{ site.url }}/web_projects/quest/">Quest - Goal Tracking Application</a></h4>
<p>Quest is a goal tracking web application built with Ruby on Rails.  Users create and manage "quests", designated lengths of time a user expects to pursue specific goals in his/her life.  The Quest application tracks current progress towards that goal and previous progress records, assigning ranks based on total time accumulated. Future plans for this application include a larger emphasis on gamification, making daily goal tracking more exciting.</p>

<h4><a title="Jacob Swartzentruber Portfolio" href="https://github.com/jacobswartzentruber/jacobswartzentruber.github.io">Portfolio - This Blog</a></h4>
<p>This portfolio/blog is written using Jekyll, a blog-aware, static site generator.  I am using a theme written by Michael Rose entitled "Skinny Bones."  Since Jekyll gives the developer access to all source code, however, I have added on bits and pieces to this theme.  I have constructed most of the pages, defined Sass methods and tweaked javascript event handling.  There is no back-end technology behind this blog, so it has allowed me to focus and practice my front-end development skills.</p>
