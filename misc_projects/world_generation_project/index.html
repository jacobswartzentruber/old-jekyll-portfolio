<p style="text-align:center;"><h3>Synopsis</h3></p>
<p>The World Generation Project is a world creation tool that procedurally generates an environment represented by elevation, temperature and precipitation.  Each time the program runs, the generator outputs a completely unique map based upon algorithms dictating elevation fluctuation, ocean depth, equator position etc.  The map is then categorized into biomes as dictated by localized temperature and precipitation.  Finally, randomized vegetation species are unleashed upon the world, ultimately finding root in areas of the map suited to their soil type preference.</p>
<p>The World Generation Project represents step one in a long sequence of future personal projects.  Ultimately, I aim to create an interactive world in which multiple characters roam around the environment, interacting with the landscape and with each other.  The player will control a few characters, a family if you will, struggling to keep them alive and increase their fortunes.</p>

<p>Shown above is one such map created by the generator.  The three pictures in the slideshow represent the three overlays responsible for defining how the world functions: elevation, temperature and precipitation. Beginning with the elevation overlay, the blue color represents ocean and the graded variants of light green represent land.  The lighter the color of an individual tile, the higher the tile is in elevation.  Conversely, the darker the tile, the lower it is on the elevation plane.</p>
<p>Moving on to the second overlay, the temperature map is defined within a range from 0 to 100 degrees.  Higher temperatures exhibit warmer colors and as the temperature decreases the colors become cooler.  The equator of the map is located midway down the map and is defined as the hottest latitude.  As tiles proceed farther and farther away from the equator their temperature drops accordingly.  Additionally, tiles higher in elevation reduce the local temperature.  The two-variable combination of elevation and latitude consistently create visually appealing temperature gradients.</p>
<p>Finally, the precipitation overlay is its own unique, randomized field of Perlin Noise.  In this map, blue represents more moisture in a tile while black represents lack of moisture.</p>
<h3 class="center">Biomes</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">To give the world variety and some semblance of organization the next step in generation is to assign biomes to various regions of the world.  Each tile is assigned a biome as determined by local temperature and moisture.  For instance, if a tile has very low temperature it will be assigned a "Scorched," "Bare", "Tundra" or "Snow" biome depending on the moisture content.  While not especially distinguishable visually, each biome is assigned a soil color which can be seen on the elevation map if you look hard enough.  The easiest one to see is "Snow" which is represented as white.  The simplest way to determine biomes is to hover your mouse over a tile in the program triggering a printout at the bottom of the screen.  Biomes help break the monotony of the standard map and allow localized trends to occur among other elements including population of vegetation.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><h3>Vegetation Population</h3></p>

</figure>
<p style="text-align:left;">Populating the world with vegetation represents the first time individual agents interact with the environment and compete for control of territory.  There are three different types of vegetation that populate the world: grasses, shrubs and trees.  Grasses prefer low soil-rich biomes like tundra and taiga, trees prefer high soil-rich biomes like forests and shrubs are happy to exist in a happy medium between the two.  Within these generic types of vegetation, the world generator spawns randomized species that have concrete values for soil preference type and fertility, or ability to spread their seeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">A species of vegetation is represented on the map in two ways.  First, its type is represented in its size.  Grasses are almost mere pixels, shrubs are medium sized squares and trees are squares that almost eclipse the tile underneath.  Secondly, each species of vegetation is assigned a semi-random color to help distinguish it from its competitors.  Trees tend toward the green spectrum, shrubs toward the red and grasses toward the blue.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">For each world generated there are a pre-specified number of tree, shrub and grass species created.  Simply because a species is created does not mean it is guaranteed a place in the final world, but it does give it the opportunity to compete.  All of the species are thrown into the world and allowed to challenge others for territory.  The closer the soil richness is to the desired soil preference of a species, the higher percentage it shares of ultimately populating that tile.  The slideshow above contains three examples of focused parts of a world with and without vegetation.</p>
