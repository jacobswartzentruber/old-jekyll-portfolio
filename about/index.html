<p>Hello, my name is Jacob Swartzentruber and I am currently exploring the world that is Ruby on Rails with the hope of eventually becoming a professional developer.  A Curious Crossbreed is a record of this process and a place for aggregating any reference material I find particularly useful.</p>
<p>When I find time to break from studying and need time to clear my head, I enjoy rock climbing, running, drawing and cooking.  Put me in front of a particularly fascinating climbing problem or a well-stocked kitchen and stress immediately melts away.</p>
<p>I appreciate feedback of all kinds and welcome open dialogue concerning any topic this blog might touch on.  If you want to get in contact with me please leave a comment or send me an email at jsswart@gmail.com.</p>
